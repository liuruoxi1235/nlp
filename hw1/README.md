2.1 
Question 1
The mainly responsible grammar rule for long sentences is NP NP PP. As this grammar rule make recursive definition of NP: if this rule is choose for new NP in previous NP, the pattern will repeat util finally the other rule of NP (NP, Det, Noun) is chosen at some part. Also, as the only rule for PP is Prep and NP, it will generate another NP in the sequence, also facing the previous situation. This is likely to cause the sentence to be very long, as NP pattern can extend unlimitedly.

Question 2
For Noun, the possible rules in current grammar are (adj, Noun), and each noun words (total 5). The chance of choosing adj and Noun rule is only 1/6, and having consecutive adjectives means choosing two adj & Noun rule consecutively. The chance is only 1/36.

Question 3
Should make the weight for NP NP PP rule smaller, and the weight for Noun Adj Noun rule larger

Question 9:
Modifications:
sentence 1: 
NP Name
Name Sally
This is to ensure that NP can be formed with either an normal Noun with an article or just a name (article is not needed). As name is a special kind of noun, a different category need to be established.

sentence 2:
Verb  Verb Con Verb
NP    NP   Con NP 
Con   and
This is to make that NP can be formed with two NP combining together with "and" and two transitive verbs can be combined together to be the verb for the whole sentence

sentence 3:
VP IVP
IVP Intrans
Intrans sighed
Intrans worked
We created IVP to represent to phrase begin with an intransitive verb. In the case of sentence 3, the IVP is only consist of an intransitive verb.

sentence 4:
S  NP Verb SS
SS that NP VP
We created a type called SS (stands for sub sentence that is consist of that, NP and VP). In this case, the whole sentence will serve as a Noun in the sentence. For sentences like sentence 4, a transitive verb is needed and followed by a sub sentence.

sentence 5:
S it AV NP SS
AV perplexed
For sentences like sentence 5, we found that the verb is a different type: it is a adjective but act as a verb in the sentence (it perplexed Michael = it makes Michael perplexed). This type of verb is special and need a distinctive type. Then, the sentence is consist of it, AV, NP and a substance.

sentence 6:
S SS AV NP
Sentences like sentence 6 are similar to sentence 5 but just different in the order of the components: for sentence 6 it put the sub sentence at the beginning and does not need "it" at the beginning.

sentence 7:
Adj Adv Adj
Adv very
Sentences like sentence 7 introduce adverb that can be used to describe adjective. This type of word need a different category and Ajd can be formed with an ad verb and an adj

sentence 8
IVP Intrans PP
Even though intransitive verb cannot be followed by a noun, it can be followed by a proposition (for instance, sighed in the room). Sentences like sentence 8 just show this pattern: a phrase start with intransitive verb can be consist of an intransitive verb and a proposition phrase.

Question 10:
every pickled pickle worked in every pickled delicious president !

is it true that it perplexed every pickled pickle that every pickle and every chief of staff sighed on every pickle ? 

Sally ate that every floor pickled every very pickled chief of staff .

that every pickled president sighed in a sandwich perplexed the very pickled perplexed chief of staff !

is it true that a sandwich sighed ?

is it true that the very pickled president with a floor with the very perplexed sandwich and the pickle on every sandwich under a pickle kissed every delicious sandwich on Sally and every sandwich ?

it perplexed every sandwich that the president thought every sandwich !

the pickle wanted and understood that every sandwich sighed with Sally .

Sally wanted that Sally worked .

it perplexed Sally that Sally worked with every delicious chief of staff !
